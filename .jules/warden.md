Observation / Pruned:
Assessed JULES/BOLT's optimization adding `compression` middleware. The build pipeline broke because `tests/test.js` did not mock the new dependency `compression` for isolated module loading tests.
Alignment / Deferred:
Patched the test suite to mock the `compression` middleware gracefully. Docs updated in README.md to list built-in response compression as a core feature. Changelog updated and version bumped to 1.1.0 for a minor release indicating the new feature.

2026-03-30 — Assessment & Lifecycle
Observation / Pruned: Pruned unused 't' parameter from test callback in tests/test.js to maintain a clean signature.
Alignment / Deferred: Aligned test cases with standard node:test format when solely using node:assert assertions.
